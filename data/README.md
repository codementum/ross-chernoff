# Data Provenance
## stocks.csv
This data comes from [vega](https://github.com/vega/vega/tree/master/docs/data). It is stock prices for tech companies over a ten year period.

## elements-by-episode.csv
This data comes from [538](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bob-ross). It is which visual elements Bob Ross used in his paintings in each episode.

## bobross.csv
Using the elements-by-episode data, I've pivoted on season to create a derived file showing how often Bob Ross painted CLOUDS, MOUNTAINS, or TREES in each season. 

## acceptance.csv
Full paper acceptance rates from CHI, EuroVis, and the InfoVis track at VisWeek/VIS, from 2001-2017. Most of the data is from [Steve Haroz](https://github.com/steveharoz/Vis-Acceptance-Rates/blob/master/acceptance%20rates.csv), except for CHI 2017, which I entered in from the [SIGCHI website](https://sigchi.org/conferences/conference-history/chi/). 

## mtcars.csv
The famous Motor Trends Cars dataset, from [R's datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).
