# Data Provenance
## stocks.csv
This data comes from [vega](https://github.com/vega/vega/tree/master/docs/data). It is stock prices for tech companies over a ten year period.

## elements-by-episode.csv
This data comes from [538](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bob-ross). It is which visual elements Bob Ross used in his paintings in each episode.

## bobross.csv
Using the elements-by-episode data, I've pivoted on season to create a derived file showing how often Bob Ross painted CLOUDS, MOUNTAINS, or TREES in each season.
